# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
Our Client, Louise, wants to know how different "Play" campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
Analyising how each of these two parameters, **_campaign launch dates_** and **_their funding goals_**, can effect the"play" campaigns **outcome** using data provided with the Kickstarter file.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
